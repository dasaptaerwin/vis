## about

A repository for codes and data for a paper that we sent to The 2018 Annual ITB International Geothermal Workshop. We apply some PCA and Cluster Analysis to the dataset using Pandas Python. 

This repository is related to the following article:
- Title: "Using hydrochemistry and simple visualization to differentiate groundwater samples". 
- Authors: "Dasapta Erwin Irawan, Arif Susanto, Prihadi Sumintadireja, Budi Brahmantyo, Deny Juanda Puradimaja"

## structure

This repository consists of:

- main file `IIGW2018-Copy1.ipynb`: contains text, code and output (in tables or plots)
- output files (tables and plots in png files)
- data file `data_arifs_2.csv`

# instructions

## installation
Assuming you have Python distribution installed, then please follow these instructions. If you don't have it, the easiest way is to install Anaconda Python distribution. You can find the download page [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJC6ldI3hWk).
